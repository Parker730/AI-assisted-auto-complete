# AI-assisted-auto-complete
I am a fast typer, just got a new keyboard, if adjusting to the keyboard wasn't enough I am having trouble with all the other AI assisted writing tools because they often can't process Hinglish if I am talking to someonr casually or something technical when I am in a professional situation. 
I'll train my model on the terms used in Hinglish and IT by using NLP with Pytorch/Tensorflow to process the weights of different possibilities and Flask API to communicate with the core program.
I just got 5 red underlines because Grammerly thinks I can't spell torch, English and it doesn't know the meanings of NLP, Pytorch, Tensorfow and API.
